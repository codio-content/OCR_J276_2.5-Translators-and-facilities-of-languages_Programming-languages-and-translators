There is only one language that the CPU of a computer can understand and that is **machine code** or **machine language**.

Therefore all programs must be presented to it in that language which has only two characters, 1 and 0, the digits of the binary system. 

All the instructions that the CPU has to execute are strings of 1s and 0s.

The CPU interprets the strings of binary digits as instructions and data. 

Each type of microprocessor has a fixed number of commands that it can understand. These make up the CPU’s **instruction set** and they are different for the different types of microprocessor.

A program written in machine code for one type of CPU would not work on a different one.

The instructions for the microprocessor have two parts or ‘fields’. The two fields are the **opcode** and the **operand**.

The opcode specifies the operation that is to be performed, for example add numbers or store data in a memory location.

The operand represents the data that are to be used, or the memory location in which the data can be found or have to be stored.

Machine code is referred to as a **low level language**.

In the case of machine code, the instructions are identical to the instruction set.
