Assembly language is also a low level language although the instructions are not identical but are very similar and each instruction in assembly language is directly equivalent to one in machine code.

As it is difficult for humans to think and write programs in pure machine code using 1s and 0s assembly language used words called mnemonics to replace the commands represented as strings of 1s and 0s.
For example LOAD, ADD and STO are mnemonics used to represent the binary commands to load numbers into the accumulator, add numbers and store them in the memory location indicated by the operand.

Assembly language is often used in the programs used by embedded systems such as those in cameras, microwaves and televisions as it can be used to directly control system hardware.
