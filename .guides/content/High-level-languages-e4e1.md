Programming in assembly language is more user-friendly than using machine code, but it is still more difficult than writing programs in a high-level language which resembles a human language.
High level languages provide built-in data structures and constructs such as selection (if…then) and iteration (while…endwhile) and have libraries of functions that programmers can use instead of having to write them all themselves.
A vast number of different high-level languages are available, such as Python, Java, C and Visual Basic, and most programs are written in high level languages.

They are at a higher level of abstraction from the actual computer hardware (hence high level languages) and focus more on the programming logic rather than using the underlying hardware components such as memory addressing.

### Advantages of writing programs in high level languages

- It is less time consuming to write, test and debug the program and so there is faster program development.
- It is not necessary to remember all of the CPU registers or mnemonic instructions.
- Portability of a program from one machine to other as most high-level languages are generally portable across different CPUs unlike low level languages

### Advantages of writing programs in low level languages

- They require less memory and have a faster execution time
- Allow programmer to directly control system hardware and are used extensively for programming embedded systems
